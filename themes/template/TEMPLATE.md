- Very slow parallax or drift.
- Optional glow/halo effect.

### Layer 3 â€“ Distant Environment

- Mountains, volcanoes, futuristic skylines, forest silhouettes, etc.
- Faded tones to appear far away.
- Parallax effect (moves very slowly).

### Layer 4 â€“ Midground Environment

- Closer structures like cliffs, trees, buildings, or lava rivers.
- Stronger contrast and detail.
- Slightly faster parallax scroll than Layer 3.

### Layer 5 â€“ Foreground Environment

- Closest objects (rocks, trees, city streets, glowing tech, etc.).
- Highest contrast, bold shapes.
- May include reflective surfaces, glowing cracks, or strong textures.

### Layer 6 â€“ Atmospheric Overlay
